A  “Grievance/Complaint”  is  defined  as  any communication  that  expresses  dissatisfaction  about  an  action 
or  lack  of  action, about  the  standard  of  service/deficiency  of  service  of  an  institute  and  the complainant  
asks for remedial action.Grievance  Redress  Mechanism  is  part  and  parcel  of  the machinery of any administration. 
This project is such an outcome of our college grievance redressal system in 5 categories namely academics, sports, events, hostel and mess and other issues.
